# fetch-tarball.sh FILE DIR: an upstream tarball that SOURCES lists, put into DIR.
# It downloads from the "from:" URL that SOURCES gives for FILE, keeps it only if its
# SHA-256 is the one SOURCES gives, and leaves a file already in DIR alone. A FILE that
# SOURCES gives no URL for (zlib, from AROS's ports cache) can't be fetched: put it
# in DIR yourself. Used by build.sh and Datatypes/build.sh when a tarball is missing,
# so a fresh clone builds with no files from anywhere else.
