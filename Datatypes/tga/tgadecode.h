/*
 * opentga.datatype's decoder: Targa (TGA) pictures read on the Amiga itself,
 * written from Truevision's TGA File Format Specification 2.0. No other
 * library.
 *
 * Image types 1, 2 and 3 (colour-mapped, true-colour and greyscale) and
 * their run-length encoded forms 9, 10 and 11. Colour-mapped pictures with
 * 8 or 16-bit indexes and a 15, 16, 24 or 32-bit colour map; true-colour
 * pictures of 15, 16, 24 and 32 bits; greyscale of 8 bits, or 16 with
 * alpha. Rows bottom-up (the default) or top-down, and right to left. Run
 * packets may cross the end of a row, as version 1 files let them.
 *
 * The picture comes out as 0xAARRGGBB words, top row first. Alpha is taken
 * from a 32-bit pixel or colour map entry, the top bit of a 16-bit one, or
 * a 16-bit greyscale pixel's second byte, when the header gives the
 * picture attribute (alpha) bits; a TGA 2.0 extension area that says the
 * alpha is not there, or not to be used, wins, and premultiplied alpha is
 * undone. An alpha channel that is 0 everywhere is taken as none: some
 * writers give 32-bit pictures an empty one.
 *
 * Built to run as a job on another core later, as png_decode() is:
 * tga_decode() makes no OS calls, writes no static data and touches only
 * the memory it is handed.
