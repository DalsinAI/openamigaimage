# opentga.datatype's decoder on x86 or ARM64 cores: makes the test pictures
# (tests/make-tga.py; with Pillow installed it also checks Pillow reads them
# the same way), decodes each with tga/tgadecode.c built for this computer
# (tests/tgatest.c) and compares every picture with what make-tga.py says it
# decodes to. Then every file cut short at every length, and with each
# header byte changed, under AddressSanitizer and UBSan: nothing is read or
# written outside the file or the picture.
