/*
 * stream.datatype: the "data" class of the datatypes system, beside
 * picture.datatype and sound.datatype. An object of it turns one format of
 * bytes into another: gzip.datatype (gzip, zlib and raw deflate) and
 * brotli.datatype are its first subclasses. A program reads the plain
 * bytes either all at once, or a piece at a time as the coded bytes arrive
 * (an HTTP body), with memory that stays bounded however long the stream.
 *
 * Whole buffer: open the source as any datatype, from a file or from
 * memory, naming the datatype when the data has no magic bytes (Brotli has
 * none, so a browser names it from the Content-Encoding header):
 *
 *     o = NewDTObject(name, DTA_GroupID, GID_DATA, TAG_DONE);
 *     o = NewDTObject(NULL, DTA_SourceType, DTST_MEMORY,
 *                     DTA_SourceAddress, buf, DTA_SourceSize, len,
 *                     DTA_BaseName, "brotli", DTA_GroupID, GID_DATA, TAG_DONE);
 *     GetDTAttrs(o, SDTA_Data, &data, SDTA_DataSize, &size, TAG_DONE);
 *
 * NewDTObject() fails on damaged data, with the reason in IoErr(). The
 * object owns SDTA_Data; it goes with DisposeDTObject().
 *
 * Streaming: create the object with no source (DTST_RAM) and feed it, or
 * open a file or memory source with SDTA_Streaming set, or give it a hook
 * that hands it the coded bytes when it needs them (SDTA_InputHook):
 *
 *     o = NewDTObject(NULL, DTA_SourceType, DTST_RAM, DTA_BaseName, "gzip",
 *                     DTA_GroupID, GID_DATA, TAG_DONE);
 *     for each piece of the body:
 *         DoMethod(o, SDTM_FEED, NULL, piece, length);
 *         while ((n = DoMethod(o, SDTM_TAKE, NULL, buf, sizeof buf, 0, 0)) > 0)
 *             use n bytes;
 *     DoMethod(o, SDTM_END, NULL);
 *     take what is left, until sdtt_Flags has SDTF_END (or SDTF_ERROR)
 *
 * Every message has a GadgetInfo pointer second, as DTM_WRITE's has, so
 * DoMethod() and DoDTMethod() both deliver it as written (pass NULL).
 *
 * DTM_WRITE with DTWM_RAW writes the plain bytes to dtw_FileHandle, so a
 * viewer can save a .gz file decoded. DTWM_IFF is refused.
 *
 * The group, GID_DATA, is new: our own datatypes library accepts it by
 * design; that AmigaOS 3.2's datatypes.library accepts a group it does not
 * know is still to be checked on the bench.
 *
 * Writing a decoder: subclass "stream.datatype" (version 47) and answer
 * SDTM_CODEC. The class does the rest: the sources, the input queue, the
 * whole-buffer decode, SDTM_FEED, SDTM_TAKE and SDTM_END, DTM_WRITE and the
 * errors.
